# KSP's Wiki Preservation Project :: CHANGE LOG

* 2025-0403: April 2025 deliverable
	+ I made something very, verey stupid on the code and literaly binned a month of work: I essentially scraped the same page over and over again, wasting almost 5GB of bandwidth. #facepalm
		- Scraping will be suspended until I fix this problem.
* 2025-0302: First release of the archive.
	+ I'm scraping it for months already, but never got the time to do a proper release. Now I did. :)
