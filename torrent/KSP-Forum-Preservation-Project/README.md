# KSP's Forum Preservation Project

Efforts for preserving [KSP's Forum](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/) for the posteriority if the worst happens.

This is the Internet Archive's torrent entry with the scraped files. See the project's README (link below) for the gory details.

We are hoping for the best, but expecting the worst. The hard part will be to expect the worst [without causing it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-fulfilling_prophecy)...


## In a Hurry

* Downloads:
	+  ~~[Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/KSP-Forum-Preservation-Project)~~
		- Internet Archive is currently mostly down, so the download page is temporarily unavailable.
	+ [buzzheavier.com](https://buzzheavier.com/fl/GaCLgPsR4AA)
		- I was reticent to upload the current archived material on some fishy fire sharing site, but things are what things are.
		- Monitor this site's reputation [here](https://www.urlvoid.com/scan/buzzheavier.com/). If anything fishy is reported, consider avoiding downloading from this one.
		- And remember, all the files on the dataset are **signed**. Check that signatures!
	+ Others?
		- As long doesn't costs me money neither remove the files if nobody downloads them for some time, what ruled out Google Drive, Dropbox and GoFile.

## Contents

This torrent contains:

* `WARC` files, to be used to a tool like `pywb` or anything else that knows what a `.warc` file is.
* `.sig` files, with the digital signature on each artefact so you can sure whatever you have is the data I had published without tampering.
	+ a `verify.sh` `bash` script, that will verify integrity of the signed files.
+ `allowed_signers` contains the public key used to sign the files. It **must** be identical to the one published on the project's repo ([here](https://github.com/net-lisias-ksp/KSP-Forum-Preservation-Project/tree/master/torrent/KSP-Forum-Preservation-Project)).
+ a bunch of `.md` files with minimal documentation (like this text). Refer to the project's repository (see "Source" above) for complete ones.


## DISCLAIMER

We are not cheap work force. We are not doing it for "them".

We are doing it for ourselves in a way that "they" would also be benefited, we are working to achieve a win-win situation.

Yes, they royally screwed the pooch and there's a chance we would be helping to save their sorry arses. But we are doing it to save our own - saving theirs is a compromise to enhance our chances. ;)
