## Downloading IA's forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com_202305

To anyone willing to download the Internet Archive data, this dataset doesn't have a torrent, unfortunately.

So I made this little script to download that huge basket of bytes using wget with the option to recover the downloads if things goes south in the process. Worst case scenario, you run the script again, no data loss.
