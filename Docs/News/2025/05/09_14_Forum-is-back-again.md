# Here we go again: Forum is down

At May 9th, 2025 aproximately 14:45 Zulu Forum came back for me.

Still don't have a clue about what happened, but since no one had complained about on Forum (once it's back), Reddit or Steam, there's a chance the problem were quickly fixed (or just affected a few users).

Anyway, move on: nothing to see here... ðŸ˜‹
