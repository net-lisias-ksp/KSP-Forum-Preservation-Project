# Forum will be down this Monday (April 14) for migration and updating 

Oukey, we had some rollercoasting emotions since December about Forum - but things are not that bad as some people used to think (if at all).

But this doesn't means that some inconveniences are not going to happen.

One of them is that Forum will, purposely and under schedule, go down for update and migration (they are moving the hosting services to Invision, the same maker of the Software).

Nothing bad is expected to happen, but *sheet* :P flies with the Wind and Murphy is lurking so, if Destiny calls, there's the Forum's Preservation Project where Forum was being archived since June 2024 for, as the name says, preservation.

And yes, the wiki too. See the project's README.
