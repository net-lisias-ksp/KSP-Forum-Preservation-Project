## `KSP's Forum` and `Web Archive` outage

Yes, it happened. They gone South somewhere after 2024-10-16T01:03:29Z (the last successful "ping" I got from them) ~~and still down at the moment of this writing, 2024-1022T0018z . I'm terribly sad.~~ and came back (finally) on 2024-1028.

This document summarises the event chronologically:

* [October 2024](./10/):
	+ Forum was down for the last half of the month.
* [November 2024](./11/):
	+ Web Archive came back from the dead.
	+ Buzzheavier gone *kaput* for my purposes.
