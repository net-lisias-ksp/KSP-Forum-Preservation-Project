# KSP's Forum Preservation Project :: News :: 2024-1023

## Someone is finally doing something

Dakota, former Community Manager for KSP, [said on Twitter/X](https://x.com/DakotaCxc/status/1848907185465819210) that he was told by his contacts that Forum is down due

> a small configuration issue, so with the proper changes, there shouldn't be any data loss.

To be fair, it's exactly what [Vanamond3 said back](https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1g4j9rn/comment/ls8ex0o/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) then on the beggining of the crisis. That, by the way, [came back to Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1gannrg/comment/ltfnqko/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) today to say

> The contact we contacted has contacted his contact who has now been granted access to do something to something.

Adding injury to the insult, this *krapstorm** happened just a couple days after SpaceX managed to pull one of the biggest stunts of the History of the Spacefaring (the StarShip 5 flight and landing on the mechazilla's chop sticks) - and, yet, Forum was kept down due a "small configuration issue".

Speaking frankly... If this is really**\*\*** what's happening, and the Internet Archive and Fortinet dramas were just coincidences, this also means that Forum is down for a whole week due Negligence and/or Incompetence.

And I really don't know what could be worse. :/


**\*\*** I'm not doubting Dakota neither Vanamond3, I firmly believe they are telling the truth. What's different of everybody on the contact chain telling the truth. Corporation Politics sucks.
