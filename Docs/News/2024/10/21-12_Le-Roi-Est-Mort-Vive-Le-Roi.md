# KSP's Forum Preservation Project :: News :: 2024-1017T12:18z

## Le Roi Est Mort, Vive Le Roi?

People are, understandably, getting unrest and assuming the worst - and starting moves to replace the Forum.

Losing Forum will play havoc on the Community. As was wisely stated by Gargamel on Forum, it will be Darwinism from that point. And Darwinism implies the strongest "preying" on the weakest.

And nobody is weaker on this relationship than the User.

Forum had its flaws, but it had its strong points too - being one of the strongest being a Lighthouse to the Community, the place where one could reliability reach "official" support (or the most official one can be), and Forum was it for more than 10 years already.

Trying to replace it will unavoidably split whatever is left from the Community we had, and I would like that such splitage could be prevented somehow.

But life is what life is. If the worst really happens, we have secured more or less 98% of the Topics/Threads (besides I didn't managed to archive more than 40% of the profiles, damn) in a **public** available dataset here:

That is only the raw data. We need somewhere to host a frontend, build a search engine to make the thing useful as a reference source and, of course, someone to foot the bill of keeping this thing online.

What would be another problem - usually, whoever foots the bill call the shots and I had witnessed this happening constantly over the 6 years I'm part of this Community, where people footing money were pushing their weight over the ones that don't. And this is yet another point in which Forum is going to be utterly missed IMHO.
