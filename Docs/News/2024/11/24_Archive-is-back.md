## Internet Archive if fully operational

I just realised today that the I.A. torrent is back to read/write to me. I just updated it with the October 2024 assets.

Relevant [entry](https://blog.archive.org/2024/11/14/learning-from-cyberattacks/) on Archive's blog.

## Buzzheavier deleted the assets

On the other hand, Buzzheavier deleted the assets and removed the account.

[Apparently they got some heat and the police raided their servers](https://buzzheavier.com/announcement).

Given how they will operate in the future, I don't think it will be a viable alternative anymore.

From the announcement:

> ## Update: Privacy and Recent Events
> ### The Problem
> Buzzheavier has been abused by people uploading CP. Due to this, law enforcement raided our servers and sought access to all the files uploaded.
>
>### Technical Details
>Those files were encrypted. I no longer have the SSH key that allows access to the encryption server. Without access, I can't log in, and due to strict requirements, the hosting provider won't let me do anything without the SSH key.
>
> ### Result
> Due to this, I won't be able to access or restore the files. The police will also be unable to recover the files uploaded by people. Buzzheavier doesn't keep logs of who uploads or downloads files, so there was nothing to be provided to the police.

> ### Future Plan
> * In the future, Buzzheavier will be scanning for CP to prevent another disaster. A new storage database will be used.
> * Inactive files will be deleted after 30, 60, or 120 days. The purpose of the site is to host files that people want to download. If nobody is downloading a file, then thereâ€™s no reason to keep it.
